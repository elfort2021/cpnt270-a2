## Cultural Signifigance of Owls for Native Americans
People often allude to the reputation of owls as bearers of supernatural danger when they tell misbehaving children, **"the owls will get you"**, and in most Native American folklore, owls are a symbol of death. For example:
  - According to the *Apache* and *Seminole* tribes, hearing owls hooting is considered the subject of numerous "boogeyman" stories told to warn children to remain indoors at night or not to cry too much, otherwise the owl may carry them away.
  - In some tribal legends, owls are associated with spirits of the dead, and the bony circles around an owl's eyes are said to comprise the fingernails of apparitional humans. Sometimes owls are said to carry messages from beyond the grave or deliver supernatural warnings to people who have broken tribal taboos.

The *Aztecs* and the *Maya*, along with other natives of Mesoamerica, considered the owl a symbol of death and destruction. 
  - The Aztec god of death, Mictlantecuhtli, was often depicted with owls. There is an old saying in Mexico that is still in use: 
  > "Cuando el tecolote canta, el indio muere"
    ("When the owl cries/sings, the Indian dies"). 
The *Popol Vuh*, a Mayan religious text, describes owls as messengers of Xibalba (the Mayan "Place of Fright").


The belief that owls are messengers and harbingers of the dark powers is also found among the *Hočągara* (Winnebago) of Wisconsin.
  - In earlier days the Hočągara committed the sin of killing enemies while they were within the sanctuary of the chief's lodge, an owl appeared and spoke to them in the voice of a human, saying, "From now on, the Hočągara will have no luck." This marked the beginning of the decline of their tribe.
  - An owl appeared to Glory of the Morning, the only female chief of the Hočąk nation, and uttered her name. Soon afterwards, she died.

According to the culture of the *Hopi*, a Uto-Aztec tribe, taboos surround owls, which are associated with sorcery and other evils.

  The *Ojibwe* tribes, as well as their Aboriginal Canadian counterparts, used an owl as a symbol for both evil and death. In addition, they used owls as a symbol of very high status of spiritual leaders of their spirituality.

The Pawnee tribes viewed owls as the symbol of protection from any danger within their realms.
