Captains Log, stardate: Jan 24 2021
 Spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get my svgs into the appropriate file in VS code, forgetting I can just do it in my finder. Hilarious start. 
 Images of Kali and SVGS for logo are linked and in the right place. Big win. 
 Image/logo commit complete!

 Shoutout to Erica T and Kyle W for the assistance/moral support. 

Still trying to figure out format for lisencing in the readme: going with this for now. Don't want to lose the links but pretty sure I don't need them. Will confirm.
